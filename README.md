# Xamarin.Android Samples
## RecyclerView Sample
Available [here](https://github.com/anaselhajjaji/xamarin-samples/tree/master/Xamarin.Android/JsonRecyclerView).

The idea is to download a big JSON over HTTP GET (JSON size is 8mo and contains 30.000 records).
The images will be downloaded asynchrounously during scrolling.
Used components: RecyclerView and HandlerThread.
